# java-design-patterns

This project is a software application directed to people who love to read or hear books online. Our project helps them to store and classify their books into three main categories, which are 'AUDIO BOOK', 'WRITTEN BOOK' and 'BOOK PAIR'

the system was mainly designed using four design patterns. To start with, i implemented the template pattern for our abstract class (Book)that implements comparable interface, because we need the other two subclasses (AudioBook , WrittenBook) to extends its content. Then, we used factory pattern to create (Bookfactory) class that we will use to create Audio/Written book objects. After that, we created (BookPair) class using facade pattern to hide the complexity. This class is used to create AudioBook object and WrittenBook object at the same time and treat them both like one object. In addition, i used singleton pattern to create (BookList) generic class, because we only need one object from it. the main purpose of this class is to store all the books in the list. We also have (BookSet) class. i made this class for two reasons. The first one is to store Audio/Written book in a tree set because it doesn't allow duplicates. And the second reason is to give us the ability to get price statistics easily.
